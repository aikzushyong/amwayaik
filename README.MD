# Aik's Amway GIT Repo

This is where I put my ansible poc and documentations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. A Linux Engineer and a laptop with Linux/Putty
2. A github account.
3. A sublime text editor.


```
Make sure you have root access to the servers.
```

### Installing

Install Sublime 3

Install GitSavvy Plugin

```
Hit Ctrl+Shift+P in Windows and Look for Install package
```

And add the following entry in gitsavvy-sublime.settings file to the path where you installed your GIT.exe

```
	"git_path": {
                "default": "",
                "windows": "C:/Users/myu074zg/OneDrive - Amway Corp/PortableGit-2.17.0-64-bit.7z/bin/git.exe"
            },
```

I don't have admin access to my work laptop so everything I used is portable version.

Using GitSavvy
```
1. To enter into the git mode:
Ctrl + Shft + P -> git:status 

2. To update to git is to: 
a. Stage
b. Commit
c. Push to github.
```
